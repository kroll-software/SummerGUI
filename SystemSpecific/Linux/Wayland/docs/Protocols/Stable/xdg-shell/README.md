Create desktop-style surfaces


The xdg_wm_base interface is exposed as a global object enabling clients
to turn their wl_surfaces into windows in a desktop environment. It
defines the basic functionality needed for clients and the compositor to
create windows that can be dragged, resized, maximized, etc, as well as
creating transient windows such as popup menus.

**Create a shell surface from a surface**

This creates an xdg_surface for the given surface. An xdg_surface is
used as basis to define a role to a given surface, such as xdg_toplevel
or xdg_popup. It also manages functionality shared between xdg_surface
based surface roles.

While xdg_surface itself is not a role, the corresponding surface may
only be assigned a role extending xdg_surface, such as xdg_toplevel or
xdg_popup. It is illegal to create an xdg_surface for a wl_surface which
already has anassigned role and this will result in a role error.

See the documentation of xdg_surface for more details about what an
xdg_surface is and how it is used.

**Check if the client is alive**

The ping event asks the client if it's still alive. Pass the
serial specified in the event back to the compositor by sending
a "pong" request back with the specified serial. See xdg_wm_base.pong.

Compositors can use this to determine if the client is still
alive. It's unspecified what will happen if the client doesn't
respond to the ping request, or in what timeframe. Clients should
try to respond in a reasonable amount of time. The “unresponsive”
error is provided for compositors that wish to disconnect unresponsive
clients.

A compositor is free to ping in any way it wants, but a client must
always respond to any xdg_wm_base object it created.

Child surface positioner


The xdg_positioner provides a collection of rules for the placement of a
child surface relative to a parent surface. Rules can be defined to ensure
the child surface remains within the visible area's borders, and to
specify how the child surface changes its position, such as sliding along
an axis, or flipping around a rectangle. These positioner-created rules are
constrained by the requirement that a child surface must intersect with or
be at least partially adjacent to its parent surface.

See the various requests for details about possible rules.

At the time of the request, the compositor makes a copy of the rules
specified by the xdg_positioner. Thus, after the request is complete the
xdg_positioner object can be destroyed or reused; further changes to the
object will have no effect on previous usages.

For an xdg_positioner object to be considered complete, it must have a
non-zero size set by set_size, and a non-zero anchor rectangle set by
set_anchor_rect. Passing an incomplete xdg_positioner object when
positioning a surface raises an invalid_positioner error.

**Set anchor rectangle anchor**

Defines the anchor point for the anchor rectangle. The specified anchor
is used to derive an anchor point that the child surface will be
positioned relative to. If a corner anchor is set (e.g. 'top_left' or

**Set child surface gravity**

Defines in what direction a surface should be positioned, relative to
the anchor point of the parent surface. If a corner gravity is
specified (e.g. 'bottom_right' or 'top_left'), then the child surface
will be placed towards the specified gravity; otherwise, the child

| Argument | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| constraint_adjustment | uint | Bit mask of constraint adjustments |

**Set the adjustment to be done when constrained**

Specify how the window should be positioned if the originally intended
position caused the surface to be constrained, meaning at least
partially outside positioning boundaries set by the compositor. The
adjustment is set by constructing a bitmask describing the adjustment to
be made when the surface is constrained on that axis.

If no bit for one axis is set, the compositor will assume that the child
surface should not change its position on that axis when constrained.

If more than one bit for one axis is set, the order of how adjustments
are applied is specified in the corresponding adjustment descriptions.

The default adjustment is none.

```csharp
void SetOffset(int x, int y)
```

| Argument | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| x | int | Surface position x offset |
| y | int | Surface position y offset |

**Set surface position offset**

Specify the surface position offset relative to the position of the
anchor on the anchor rectangle and the anchor on the surface. For
example if the anchor of the anchor rectangle is at (x, y), the surface
has the gravity bottom|right, and the offset is (ox, oy), the calculated
surface position will be (x + ox, y + oy). The offset position of the
surface is the one used for constraint testing. See
set_constraint_adjustment.

An example use case is placing a popup menu on top of a user interface
element, while aligning the user interface element of the parent surface
with some user interface element placed somewhere in the popup surface.

**Set parent size**

Set the parent window geometry the compositor should use when
positioning the popup. The compositor may use this information to
determine the future state the popup should be constrained using. If
this doesn't match the dimension of the parent the popup is eventually
positioned against, the behavior is undefined.

Constraint adjustments


The constraint adjustment value define ways the compositor will adjust
the position of the surface, if the unadjusted position would result
in the surface being partly constrained.

Whether a surface is considered 'constrained' is left to the compositor
to determine. For example, the surface may be partly outside the
compositor's defined 'work area', thus necessitating the child surface's
position be adjusted until it is entirely inside the work area.

The adjustments can be combined, according to a defined precedence: 1)
Flip, 2) Slide, 3) Resize.

Desktop user interface surface base interface


An interface that may be implemented by a wl_surface, for
implementations that provide a desktop-style user interface.

It provides a base set of functionality required to construct user
interface elements requiring management by the compositor, such as
toplevel windows, menus, etc. The types of functionality are split into
xdg_surface roles.

Creating an xdg_surface does not set the role for a wl_surface. In order
to map an xdg_surface, the client must create a role-specific object
using, e.g., get_toplevel, get_popup. The wl_surface for any given
xdg_surface can have at most one role, and may not be assigned any role
not based on xdg_surface.

A role must be assigned before any other requests are made to the
xdg_surface object.

The client must call wl_surface.commit on the corresponding wl_surface
for the xdg_surface state to take effect.

Creating an xdg_surface from a wl_surface which has a buffer attached or
committed is a client error, and any attempts by a client to attach or
manipulate a buffer prior to the first xdg_surface.configure call must
also be treated as errors.

After creating a role-specific object and setting it up (e.g. by sending
the title, app ID, size constraints, parent, etc), the client must
perform an initial commit without any buffer attached. The compositor
will reply with initial wl_surface state such as
wl_surface.preferred_buffer_scale followed by an xdg_surface.configure
event. The client must acknowledge it and is then allowed to attach a
buffer to map the surface.

Mapping an xdg_surface-based role surface is defined as making it
possible for the surface to be shown by the compositor. Note that
a mapped surface is not guaranteed to be visible once it is mapped.

For an xdg_surface to be mapped by the compositor, the following
conditions must be met:
(1) the client has assigned an xdg_surface-based role to the surface
(2) the client has set and committed the xdg_surface state and the
role-dependent state to the surface
(3) the client has committed a buffer to the surface

A newly-unmapped surface is considered to have met condition (1) out
of the 3 required conditions for mapping a surface if its role surface
has not been destroyed, i.e. the client must perform the initial commit
again before attaching a buffer.

| y | int | Y coordinate of the top-left corner of the window inside this surface |
| width | int | Width of the window |
| height | int | Height of the window |

**Set the new window geometry**

The window geometry of a surface is its "visible bounds" from the
user's perspective. Client-side decorations often have invisible
portions like drop-shadows which should be ignored for the
purposes of aligning, placing and constraining windows. Note that
in some situations, compositors may clip rendering to the window
geometry, so the client should avoid putting functional elements
outside of it.

The window geometry is double-buffered state, see wl_surface.commit.

When maintaining a position, the compositor should treat the (x, y)
coordinate of the window geometry as the top left corner of the window.
A client changing the (x, y) window geometry coordinate should in
general not alter the position of the window.

Once the window geometry of the surface is set, it is not possible to
unset it, and it will remain the same until set_window_geometry is
called again, even if a new subsurface or buffer is attached.

If never set, the value is the full bounds of the surface,
including any subsurfaces. This updates dynamically on every
commit. This unset is meant for extremely simple clients.

The arguments are given in the surface-local coordinate space of
the wl_surface associated with this xdg_surface, and may extend outside
of the wl_surface itself to mark parts of the subsurface tree as part of
the window geometry.

When applied, the effective window geometry will be the set window
geometry clamped to the bounding rectangle of the combined
geometry of the surface of the xdg_surface and the associated
subsurfaces.

The effective geometry will not be recalculated unless a new call to
set_window_geometry is done and the new pending surface state is
subsequently applied.

The width and height of the effective window geometry must be
greater than zero. Setting an invalid size will raise an
invalid_size error.

```csharp
void AckConfigure(uint serial)
```

| Argument | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| serial | uint | The serial from the configure event |

**Ack a configure event**

When a configure event is received, if a client commits the
surface in response to the configure event, then the client
must make an ack_configure request sometime before the commit
request, passing along the serial of the configure event.

For instance, for toplevel surfaces the compositor might use this
information to move a surface to the top left only when the client has
drawn itself for the maximized or fullscreen state.

If the client receives multiple configure events before it
can respond to one, it only has to ack the last configure event.
Acking a configure event that was never sent raises an invalid_serial
error.

A client is not required to commit immediately after sending
an ack_configure request - it may even ack_configure several times
before its next surface commit.

A client may send multiple ack_configure requests before committing, but
only the last request sent before a commit indicates which configure
event the client really is responding to.

Sending an ack_configure request consumes the serial number sent with
the request, as well as serial numbers sent by all configure events
sent on this xdg_surface prior to the configure event referenced by
the committed serial.

It is an error to issue multiple ack_configure requests referencing a
serial from the same configure event, or to issue an ack_configure
request referencing a serial from a configure event issued before the
event identified by the last ack_configure request for the same
xdg_surface. Doing so will raise an invalid_serial error.

**Suggest a surface change**

The configure event marks the end of a configure sequence. A configure
sequence is a set of one or more events configuring the state of the
xdg_surface, including the final xdg_surface.configure event.

Where applicable, xdg_surface surface roles will during a configure
sequence extend this event as a latched state sent as events before the
xdg_surface.configure event. Such events should be considered to make up
a set of atomically applied configuration states, where the
xdg_surface.configure commits the accumulated state.

Clients should arrange their surface for the new states, and then send
an ack_configure request with the serial sent in this configure event at
some point before committing the new surface.

If the client receives multiple configure events before it can respond
to one, it is free to discard all but the last event it received.

Toplevel surface


This interface defines an xdg_surface role which allows a surface to,
among other things, set window-like properties such as maximize,
fullscreen, and minimize, set application-specific metadata like title and
id, and well as trigger user interactive operations such as interactive
resize and move.

An xdg_toplevel by default is responsible for providing the full intended
visual representation of the toplevel, which depending on the window
state, may mean things like a title bar, window controls and drop shadow.

Unmapping an xdg_toplevel means that the surface cannot be shown
by the compositor until it is explicitly mapped again.
All active operations (e.g., move, resize) are canceled and all
attributes (e.g. title, state, stacking, ...) are discarded for
an xdg_toplevel surface when it is unmapped. The xdg_toplevel returns to
the state it had right after xdg_surface.get_toplevel. The client
can re-map the toplevel by performing a commit without any buffer
attached, waiting for a configure event and handling it as usual (see
xdg_surface description).

Attaching a null buffer to a toplevel unmaps the surface.

```csharp
void SetParent(XdgToplevel? parent)

| Argument | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| parent | object | Parent surface for this surface |

**Set the parent of this surface**

Set the "parent" of this surface. This surface should be stacked
above the parent surface and all other ancestor surfaces.

Parent surfaces should be set on dialogs, toolboxes, or other
"auxiliary" surfaces, so that the parent is raised when the dialog
is raised.

Setting a null parent for a child surface unsets its parent. Setting
a null parent for a surface which currently has no parent is a no-op.

Only mapped surfaces can have child surfaces. Setting a parent which
is not mapped is equivalent to setting a null parent. If a surface
becomes unmapped, its children's parent is set to the parent of
the now-unmapped surface. If the now-unmapped surface has no parent,
its children's parent is unset. If the now-unmapped surface becomes
mapped again, its parent-child relationship is not restored.

The parent toplevel must not be one of the child toplevel's
descendants, and the parent must be different from the child toplevel,
otherwise the invalid_parent protocol error is raised.

```csharp
void SetAppId(string appId)
```

| Argument | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| app_id | string | Application identifier surface belongs to |

**Set application ID**

Set an application identifier for the surface.

The app ID identifies the general class of applications to which
the surface belongs. The compositor can use this to group multiple
surfaces together, or to determine how to launch a new application.

For D-Bus activatable applications, the app ID is used as the D-Bus
service name.

The compositor shell will try to group application surfaces together
by their app ID. As a best practice, it is suggested to select app
ID's that match the basename of the application's .desktop file.
For example, "org.freedesktop.FooViewer" where the .desktop file is
"org.freedesktop.FooViewer.desktop".

Like other properties, a set_app_id request can be sent after the
xdg_toplevel has been mapped to update the property.

See the desktop-entry specification [0] for more details on
application identifiers and how they relate to well-known D-Bus
names and .desktop files.

| x | int | The x position to pop up the window menu at |
| y | int | The y position to pop up the window menu at |

**Show the window menu**

Clients implementing client-side decorations might want to show
a context menu when right-clicking on the decorations, giving the
user a menu that they can use to maximize or minimize the window.

This request asks the compositor to pop up such a window menu at
the given position, relative to the local surface coordinates of
the parent surface. There are no guarantees as to what menu items
the window menu contains, or even if a window menu will be drawn
at all.

This request must be used in response to some sort of user action
like a button press, key press, or touch down event.

**Start an interactive move**

Start an interactive, user-driven move of the surface.

This request must be used in response to some sort of user action
like a button press, key press, or touch down event. The passed
serial is used to determine the type of interactive move (touch,
pointer, etc).

The server may ignore move requests depending on the state of
the surface (e.g. fullscreen or maximized), or if the passed serial
is no longer valid.

If triggered, the surface will lose the focus of the device
(wl_pointer, wl_touch, etc) used for the move. It is up to the
compositor to visually indicate that the move is taking place, such as
updating a pointer cursor, during the move. There is no guarantee
that the device focus will return when the move is completed.

| edges | uint | Which edge or corner is being dragged |

**Start an interactive resize**

Start a user-driven, interactive resize of the surface.

This request must be used in response to some sort of user action
like a button press, key press, or touch down event. The passed
serial is used to determine the type of interactive resize (touch,
pointer, etc).

The server may ignore resize requests depending on the state of
the surface (e.g. fullscreen or maximized).

If triggered, the client will receive configure events with the
"resize" state enum value and the expected sizes. See the "resize"
enum value for more details about what is required. The client
must also acknowledge configure events using "ack_configure". After
the resize is completed, the client will receive another "configure"
event without the resize state.

If triggered, the surface also will lose the focus of the device
(wl_pointer, wl_touch, etc) used for the resize. It is up to the
compositor to visually indicate that the resize is taking place,
such as updating a pointer cursor, during the resize. There is no
guarantee that the device focus will return when the resize is
completed.

The edges parameter specifies how the surface should be resized, and
is one of the values of the resize_edge enum. Values not matching
a variant of the enum will cause the invalid_resize_edge protocol error.
The compositor may use this information to update the surface position
for example when dragging the top left corner. The compositor may also
use this information to adapt its behavior, e.g. choose an appropriate
cursor image.

| Argument | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| width | int | Maximum width of the window |

**Set the maximum size**

Set a maximum size for the window.

The client can specify a maximum size so that the compositor does
not try to configure the window beyond this size.

The width and height arguments are in window geometry coordinates.
See xdg_surface.set_window_geometry.

Values set in this way are double-buffered, see wl_surface.commit.

The compositor can use this information to allow or disallow
different states like maximize or fullscreen and draw accurate
animations.

Similarly, a tiling window manager may use this information to
place and resize client windows in a more effective way.

The client should not rely on the compositor to obey the maximum
size. The compositor may decide to ignore the values set by the
client and request a larger size.

If never set, or a value of zero in the request, means that the
client has no expected maximum size in the given dimension.
As a result, a client wishing to reset the maximum size
to an unspecified state can use zero for width and height in the
request.

Requesting a maximum size to be smaller than the minimum size of
a surface is illegal and will result in an invalid_size error.

The width and height must be greater than or equal to zero. Using
strictly negative values for width or height will result in an
invalid_size error.

**Set the minimum size**

Set a minimum size for the window.

The client can specify a minimum size so that the compositor does
not try to configure the window below this size.

The width and height arguments are in window geometry coordinates.
See xdg_surface.set_window_geometry.

Values set in this way are double-buffered, see wl_surface.commit.

The compositor can use this information to allow or disallow
different states like maximize or fullscreen and draw accurate
animations.

Similarly, a tiling window manager may use this information to
place and resize client windows in a more effective way.

The client should not rely on the compositor to obey the minimum
size. The compositor may decide to ignore the values set by the
client and request a smaller size.

If never set, or a value of zero in the request, means that the
client has no expected minimum size in the given dimension.
As a result, a client wishing to reset the minimum size
to an unspecified state can use zero for width and height in the

```csharp
void SetMaximized()

**Maximize the window**

Maximize the surface.

After requesting that the surface should be maximized, the compositor
will respond by emitting a configure event. Whether this configure
actually sets the window maximized is subject to compositor policies.
The client must then update its content, drawing in the configured
state. The client must also acknowledge the configure when committing
the new content (see ack_configure).

It is up to the compositor to decide how and where to maximize the
surface, for example which output and what region of the screen should
be used.

If the surface was already maximized, the compositor will still emit
a configure event with the "maximized" state.

If the surface is in a fullscreen state, this request has no direct
effect. It may alter the state the surface is returned to when
unmaximized unless overridden by the compositor.

</h3>

```csharp
void UnsetMaximized()
```


**Unmaximize the window**

Unmaximize the surface.

After requesting that the surface should be unmaximized, the compositor
will respond by emitting a configure event. Whether this actually
un-maximizes the window is subject to compositor policies.
If available and applicable, the compositor will include the window
geometry dimensions the window had prior to being maximized in the
configure event. The client must then update its content, drawing it in
the configured state. The client must also acknowledge the configure
when committing the new content (see ack_configure).

It is up to the compositor to position the surface after it was
unmaximized; usually the position the surface had before maximizing, if
applicable.

If the surface was already not maximized, the compositor will still
emit a configure event without the "maximized" state.

If the surface is in a fullscreen state, this request has no direct
effect. It may alter the state the surface is returned to when
unmaximized unless overridden by the compositor.

```csharp
void SetFullscreen(WlOutput? output)
```

| Argument | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| output | object | Preferred output to place surface on |

**Set the window as fullscreen on an output**

Make the surface fullscreen.

After requesting that the surface should be fullscreened, the
compositor will respond by emitting a configure event. Whether the
client is actually put into a fullscreen state is subject to compositor
policies. The client must also acknowledge the configure when
committing the new content (see ack_configure).

The output passed by the request indicates the client's preference as
to which display it should be set fullscreen on. If this value is NULL,
it's up to the compositor to choose which display will be used to map
this surface.

If the surface doesn't cover the whole output, the compositor will
position the surface in the center of the output and compensate with
border fill covering the rest of the output. The content of the
border fill is undefined, but should be assumed to be in some way that
attempts to blend into the surrounding area (e.g. solid black).

If the fullscreened surface is not opaque, the compositor must make
sure that other screen content not part of the same surface tree (made
up of subsurfaces, popups or similarly coupled surfaces) are not
visible below the fullscreened surface.

```csharp
void UnsetFullscreen()

**Unset the window as fullscreen**

Make the surface no longer fullscreen.

After requesting that the surface should be unfullscreened, the
compositor will respond by emitting a configure event.
Whether this actually removes the fullscreen state of the client is
subject to compositor policies.

Making a surface unfullscreen sets states for the surface based on the following:
* the state(s) it may have had before becoming fullscreen
* any state(s) decided by the compositor
* any state(s) requested by the client while the surface was fullscreen

The compositor may include the previous window geometry dimensions in
the configure event, if applicable.

The client must also acknowledge the configure when committing the new
content (see ack_configure).

| states | array | Suggested states of the window |

**Suggest a surface change**

This configure event asks the client to resize its toplevel surface or
to change its state. The configured state should not be applied
immediately. See xdg_surface.configure for details.

The width and height arguments specify a hint to the window
about how its surface should be resized in window geometry
coordinates. See set_window_geometry.

If the width or height arguments are zero, it means the client
should decide its own window dimension. This may happen when the
compositor needs to configure the state of the surface but doesn't
have any information about any previous or expected dimension.

The states listed in the event specify how the width/height
arguments should be interpreted, and possibly how it should be
drawn.

The states are sent as an array of 32-bit unsigned integers in
native endianness. State values are defined in the state enum.

Clients must send an ack_configure in response to this event. See
xdg_surface.configure and xdg_surface.ack_configure for details.

**Surface wants to be closed**

The close event is sent by the compositor when the user
wants the surface to be closed. This should be equivalent to
the user clicking the close button in client-side decorations,
if your application has any.

This is only a request that the user intends to close the
window. The client may choose to ignore this request, or show
a dialog to ask the user to save their data, etc.

**Recommended window geometry bounds**

The configure_bounds event may be sent prior to a xdg_toplevel.configure
event to communicate the bounds a window geometry size is recommended
to constrain to.

The passed width and height are in surface coordinate space. If width
and height are 0, it means bounds is unknown and equivalent to as if no
configure_bounds event was ever sent for this surface.

The bounds can for example correspond to the size of a monitor excluding
any panels or other shell components, so that a surface isn't created in
a way that it cannot fit.

The bounds may change at any point, and in such a case, a new
xdg_toplevel.configure_bounds will be sent, followed by
xdg_toplevel.configure and xdg_surface.configure.

a capability isn't supported, clients should hide or disable the UI
elements that expose this functionality. For instance, if the
compositor doesn't advertise support for minimized toplevels, a button
triggering the set_minimized request should not be displayed.

The compositor will ignore requests it doesn't support. For instance,
a compositor which doesn't advertise support for minimized will ignore
set_minimized requests.

Compositors must send this event once before the first
xdg_surface.configure event. When the capabilities change, compositors
must send this event again and then send an xdg_surface.configure
event.

The configured state should not be applied immediately. See
xdg_surface.configure for details.

The capabilities are sent as an array of 32-bit unsigned integers in
native endianness. Capability values are defined in the wm_capabilities enum.

Types of state on the surface


The different state values used on the surface. This is designed for
state values like maximized, fullscreen. It is paired with the
configure event to ensure that both the client and the compositor
setting the state can be synchronized.

States set in this way are double-buffered, see wl_surface.commit.

Short-lived, popup surfaces for menus


A popup surface is a short-lived, temporary surface. It can be used to
implement for example menus, popovers, tooltips and other similar user
interface concepts.

A popup can be made to take an explicit grab. See xdg_popup.grab for
details.

When the popup is dismissed, a popup_done event will be sent out, and at
the same time the surface will be unmapped. See the xdg_popup.popup_done
event for details.

Explicitly destroying the xdg_popup object will also dismiss the popup and
unmap the surface. Clients that want to dismiss the popup when another
surface of their own is clicked should dismiss the popup using the destroy
request.

A newly created xdg_popup will be stacked on top of all previously created
xdg_popup surfaces associated with the same xdg_toplevel.

The parent of an xdg_popup must be mapped (see the xdg_surface
description) before the xdg_popup itself.

The client must call wl_surface.commit on the corresponding wl_surface
for the xdg_popup state to take effect.

    </a>
    <span class="pill destructor">Type: destructor</span>
</h3>

```csharp
void Destroy()
```


**Remove xdg_popup interface**

This destroys the popup. Explicitly destroying the xdg_popup
object will also dismiss the popup, and unmap the surface.

If this xdg_popup is not the "topmost" popup, the
xdg_wm_base.not_the_topmost_popup protocol error will be sent.

        XdgPopup.<span class="method">Grab</span>
    </a>
</h3>

```csharp
void Grab(WlSeat seat, uint serial)
```

| Argument | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| seat | object | The wl_seat of the user event |
| serial | uint | The serial of the user event |

**Make the popup take an explicit grab**

This request makes the created popup take an explicit grab. An explicit
grab will be dismissed when the user dismisses the popup, or when the
client destroys the xdg_popup. This can be done by the user clicking
outside the surface, using the keyboard, or even locking the screen
through closing the lid or a timeout.

If the compositor denies the grab, the popup will be immediately
dismissed.

This request must be used in response to some sort of user action like a
button press, key press, or touch down event. The serial number of the
event should be passed as 'serial'.

The parent of a grabbing popup must either be an xdg_toplevel surface or
another xdg_popup with an explicit grab. If the parent is another
xdg_popup it means that the popups are nested, with this popup now being
the topmost popup.

Nested popups must be destroyed in the reverse order they were created
in, e.g. the only popup you are allowed to destroy at all times is the
topmost one.

When compositors choose to dismiss a popup, they may dismiss every
nested grabbing popup as well. When a compositor dismisses popups, it
will follow the same dismissing order as required from the client.

If the topmost grabbing popup is destroyed, the grab will be returned to
the parent of the popup, if that parent previously had an explicit grab.

If the parent is a grabbing popup which has already been dismissed, this
popup will be immediately dismissed. If the parent is a popup that did
not take an explicit grab, an error will be raised.

During a popup grab, the client owning the grab will receive pointer
and touch events for all their surfaces as normal (similar to an
"owner-events" grab in X11 parlance), while the top most grabbing popup
will always have keyboard focus.

```csharp
void Reposition(XdgPositioner positioner, uint token)
```

| Argument | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| positioner | object |  |
| token | uint | Reposition request token |

**Recalculate the popup's location**

Reposition an already-mapped popup. The popup will be placed given the
details in the passed xdg_positioner object, and a
xdg_popup.repositioned followed by xdg_popup.configure and
xdg_surface.configure will be emitted in response. Any parameters set
by the previous positioner will be discarded.

The passed token will be sent in the corresponding
xdg_popup.repositioned event. The new popup position will not take
effect until the corresponding configure event is acknowledged by the
client. See xdg_popup.repositioned for details. The token itself is
opaque, and has no other special meaning.

If multiple reposition requests are sent, the compositor may skip all
but the last one.

If the popup is repositioned in response to a configure event for its
parent, the client should send an xdg_positioner.set_parent_configure
and possibly an xdg_positioner.set_parent_size request to allow the
compositor to properly constrain the popup.

If the popup is repositioned together with a parent that is being
resized, but not in response to a configure event, the client should
send an xdg_positioner.set_parent_size request.

        XdgPopup.<span class="event">OnConfigure</span>
    </a>
</h3>

```csharp
void ConfigureHandler(int x, int y, int width, int height)
```

| Argument | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| x | int | X position relative to parent surface window geometry |
| y | int | Y position relative to parent surface window geometry |
| width | int | Window geometry width |
| height | int | Window geometry height |

**Configure the popup surface**

This event asks the popup surface to configure itself given the
configuration. The configured state should not be applied immediately.
See xdg_surface.configure for details.

The x and y arguments represent the position the popup was placed at
given the xdg_positioner rule, relative to the upper left corner of the
window geometry of the parent surface.

For version 2 or older, the configure event for an xdg_popup is only
ever sent once for the initial configuration. Starting with version 3,
it may be sent again if the popup is setup with an xdg_positioner with
set_reactive requested, or in response to xdg_popup.reposition requests.

        XdgPopup.<span class="event">OnPopupDone</span>
    </a>
</h3>

```csharp
void PopupDoneHandler()
```


**Popup interaction is done**

The popup_done event is sent out when a popup is dismissed by the
compositor. The client should destroy the xdg_popup object at this
point.

</h3>

```csharp
void RepositionedHandler(uint token)
```

| Argument | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| token | uint | Reposition request token |

**Signal the completion of a repositioned request**

The repositioned event is sent as part of a popup configuration
sequence, together with xdg_popup.configure and lastly
xdg_surface.configure to notify the completion of a reposition request.

The repositioned event is to notify about the completion of a
xdg_popup.reposition request. The token argument is the token passed
in the xdg_popup.reposition request.

Immediately after this event is emitted, xdg_popup.configure and
xdg_surface.configure will be sent with the updated size and position,
as well as a new configure serial.

The client should optionally update the content of the popup, but must
acknowledge the new popup configuration for the new position to take
effect. See xdg_surface.ack_configure for details.
