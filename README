SummerGUI

X-Platform GUI Framework
by John Summer, written in C#, MIT License

SummerGUI offers a brand new way for you to develop your next desktop application in C# that can run on any system.

It is open source and free under the MIT license, so what are you waiting for ?

This is an early development release. This software is not yet ready for production.
At this time, we want to share our development with early adopters, who might want to contribute to the code. Your help is appreciated if you are familiar with window handling on different platforms, shell dialogs and clipborad functions. Or when you have some other ideas to add..

Remarks: This code can compile on Ubuntu/MonoDevelop. It will soon be fixed to compile on Windows/VisualStudio as well.
